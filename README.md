About the Designer
Kunihiko Morinaga, founder of ANREALAGE, approaches fashion through his trinity concept of "REAL, UNREAL, AGE." The SCREEN collection represents his vision of clothing as a "second skin" that functions as an interactive communication medium, echoing the traditional role of kimono while propelling it into the digital future.

Technical Collaboration
This project showcases the collaboration between ANREALAGE and MPLUSPLUS, who developed the LED systems and lighting patterns that transform these garments into dynamic visual experiences.

Japanese Aesthetic Heritage
The collection embodies the Japanese principle of "temperature in technology" - merging precise digital innovation with the warmth of traditional craftsmanship to create a new expression of beauty that honors the past while embracing the future.
